# VisionRasperryPi
by Grant Perkins, 2018.

VisionRaspberryPi is a repository dedicated to you, a person who wants to learn how to write vision code (in Python 3) and run it on a Raspberry Pi 3. This is what I, lead programmer at the time of writing, did during the 2017-2018 season Power Up.

## [How do I install all of the stuff I need?](https://github.com/Team1100/VisionRasperryPi/blob/master/doc/installation.md)

## How do I "write" the vision processing code?

## How do I write the interface with the USB camera and with the robot?

## [How do I get the pi to run my code (client.py)?](https://github.com/Team1100/VisionRasperryPi/blob/master/doc/run.md)

## How do I incorporate this into the robot code?
